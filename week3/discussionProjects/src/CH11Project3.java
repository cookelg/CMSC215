/**
 * Write a program that prompts a user to enter an integer m and find the
 * smallest
 * integer n such that m*n is a perfect square
 * (Hint: Store all the smallest factors of m into an arary list - n is the
 * product
 * of the factors that appear an odd number of times in the array list - for
 * example
 * consider m=90, store the factors 2,3,3 and 5 in an array list - 2 and 5
 * appear an
 * odd number of times in the array list - thus n is 10)
 *
 * Sample Run:
 * >>Enter an integer m: 1500
 * >>the smallest integer n for m*n to be a perfect square is 15
 * >>m*n is 22500
